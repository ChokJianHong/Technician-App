Entities

    - Entities are needed when there will be changes in identity or behavior like a user changing the email or password
    - Example

        // lib/domain/entities/user.dart
    class User {
    final String id; // Unique identifier for the user
    final String email;
    final String name;

    User({required this.id, required this.email, required this.name});

    // Example of a method that could be in a user entity
    void updateEmail(String newEmail) {
        // Perform some business logic here, e.g., validate the email
    }
    }


1. I have added the Job Entity. 
    - This is used to hold the properties of Job
    - It is also used to make to create Job object using Json data
