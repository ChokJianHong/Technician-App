Domain Repository

    - Acts as a catalogue for us to access the operations such as fetching data
    - It provides structure and makes it easier for reusal

    - Example
        // lib/domain/repositories/book_repository.dart
    import '../entities/book.dart';

    abstract class BookRepository {
    Future<Book> getBookDetails(String bookId);
    Future<void> saveBook(Book book);
    }
